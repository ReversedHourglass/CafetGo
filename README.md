# CafetGo

CafetGo is a school project made throug my second year of UIT. This project has been developed with [Kalil Pelissier](https://github.com/kalil-pelissier) and [Théophile Grégoire](https://github.com/TheophileGreg). The goal of the project was to proove that we understood how PHP was working, but also that we understood Web principles concerning the security such as encryption of passwords, avoiding SQL injections and XSS attacks. 

It is not possible anymore to reach a demo.

We tried to use reCaptchas to add a functionality to our website, we succeeded but we removed them since it was a pain to use while running a live demo.
